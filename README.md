# Video Rental System Using PHP

This project is a video rental system developed using PHP. It's designed as a solution for managing video rentals in a store or a similar setting. 

The system allows users to browse through a catalog of videos available for rent, select videos, and manage their rentals. It also provides features for administrators to add or remove videos from the catalog, track rentals, and manage user accounts.

This project was developed as part of a school assignment to demonstrate proficiency in PHP and web development concepts. It showcases the use of PHP for server-side scripting, handling HTTP requests, interacting with databases, and generating dynamic web content.
